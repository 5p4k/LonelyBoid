# LonelyBoid
*A 2D boids library on compute shaders, multi-flock and force fields*

This is largely inspired by Sebastian Lague's [Boids](https://github.com/SebLague/Boids), check out the [Coding Adventure](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqtqltqcQhw).

**Disclaimer:** this project was created as a one-shot experiment. I do not plan on doing regular updates nor fixes, but if you want to contribute, I'll gladly merge useful changes. I do not regularly use Unity, nor regularly code in C#; I did try to keep code neat though. Check the known limitations section.
